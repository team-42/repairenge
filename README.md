# Repairenge

Repairenge is a 2D space arcade game created during the Global Game Jam 2020 at the jam site in Leipzig, Germany.

## Objective

In Repairenge, you control a space ship and try to survive attacks by other ships. There are regular opponents and boss enemies to defeat. To accomplish this, you will need to gather more components for your own ship.

## Controls

To move, use the W,A,S,D keys. To fire regular weapons, use the space bar. To fire special weapons (e.g. the railgun), use Enter.

The game can also be played with a game controller. However, not all controllers will work.

## Running the game

To run the game, either clone the repository and run `repairenge.py` or download a pre-built release for your platform and run the game executable (e.g. repairenge.exe)

## Building the game

To build an executable, execute

    pyinstaller repairenge.spec

in the main directory. If you don't have pyinstaller yet, use

    pip install pyinstaller
    
first.
